# Installation instruction #

To install Mooshak you must execute the following commands. Note that you must be root in the machine
```
	% tar xzf mooshak-version.tgz
	% cd mooshak-version
	% su	
	# ./install
```
The installation script creates an user named `mooshak` with everything you need. You can use this script to install Mooshak under a different user (for multiple installs in the same server), to un-install or to update Mooshak. Read more about it in the `README.txt` in the tarball.

After installing, you can start using Mooshak by accessing this URL in your favorite browser:
```
     http://your.machine/~mooshak 
```
